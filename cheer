Life has no value and it cannot be measured.
Water, land, and air are valuable because eventually they will run out. The same cannot be said for life.
The value of life depends on how man sees himself.
The human body traps the soul from escaping to paradise.
It is a whim of mine to keep you aboard this ship, where my piggishness flourishes. And keep you I will. I may make or break you. You may die today, this week or next month. I could kill you now, with a blow of my fist, for you are a miserable weakling."

Life? Bah! It has no value. Of cheap things it is the cheapest.
More you drink more you want.
