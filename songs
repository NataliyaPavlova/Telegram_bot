What shall we do with a drunken sailor? \nWhat shall we do with a drunken sailor? \nWhat shall we do with a drunken sailor? \nEarly in the morning\n
Way hay and up she rises \nWay hay and up she rises \nWay hay and up she rises \nEarly in the morning \n
Find him, bind him \nTie him to a pole and break \nHis fingers to splinters \nDrag him to a hole until he \nWakes up naked \nClawing at the ceiling \nOf his grave \n
Whiskey drove me around Cape Horn \nWhiskey, Johnny! \nIt was many a month when I was gone \nWhiskey for my Johnny O!\n
Let's do the trucker's hitch \n The trucker's hitch \nLet's do the trucker's hitch \nThe trucker's hitch
Oh, I am the wind the seamen love — \nI am steady, and strong, and true; \nThey follow my track by the clouds above, \nO’er the fathomless tropic blue.
