What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
Early in the morning

Way hay and up she rises
Way hay and up she rises
Way hay and up she rises
Early in the morning
*
Find him, bind him
Tie him to a pole and break
His fingers to splinters 
Drag him to a hole until he 
Wakes up naked 
Clawing at the ceiling Of his grave
*
Whiskey drove me around Cape Horn
Whiskey, Johnny! 
It was many a month when I was gone 
Whiskey for my Johnny O!
*
Let's do the trucker's hitch
The trucker's hitch
Let's do the trucker's hitch
The trucker's hitch
*
Oh, I am the wind the seamen love — 
I am steady, and strong, and true; 
They follow my track by the clouds above, 
O’er the fathomless tropic blue.
