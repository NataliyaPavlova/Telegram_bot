yelling and cursing @WolfLarsenbot 

Inspired by "Sea Wolf" by Jack London

It is deployed on Heroku and is activated.

You may add @WolfLarsenbot to a group or send a direct message to him.

Here is how it works: if you use words 'smart', 'clever', 'intelligent', 'Nietzsche', it will send you a Wolf Larsen quote 
from Jack London's 'Sea Wolf'.

If you swear, it will support you and will send a curse.

If you directly call 'WolfLarsen' or '@WolfLarsen' or '@WolfLarsenbot', it will sing for you.

The lists of quotes, curses and songs are uploaded to Heroku Redis. The bot's answer is randomly chosen every time when it is needed.


Enjoy!
